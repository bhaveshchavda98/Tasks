'''
• Defining a class is much like defining a function, but we use the class keyword instead. We
also use the word object in parentheses because we want our classes to inherit the object
class. This means that our class has all the properties of an object, which is the simplest,
most basic class.
• Define a new class named "Car". For now, since we have to put something inside the
class, use the pass keyword.
• We can use classes to create new objects, which we say are instances of those
classes.
• Below your Car class, create a new object named my_car that is an instance of Car.
'''
class Car:
    pass

my_car = Car()
